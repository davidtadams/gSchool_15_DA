# Event Exercise 01

The browser is teeming with events! To view all the events going on, open up `index.html` and put this piece of code into your Chrome Developer Tools console.

```js
monitorEvents(window)
```

Move your mouse around over the website and click around. Press some keys on your keyboard. Resize your window. If you have a motion sensor in your device move your device around. Try a bunch of things and see if JavaScript events show up.
