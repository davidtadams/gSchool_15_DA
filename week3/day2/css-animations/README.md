# CSS ANIMATION

The human brain is hardwired to pay attention to motion. Because of this natural reflex to notice movement, adding animation to your website or app is a powerful way to draw users attention to key areas of your product and add appeal to your interface.

When animation is used properly, animation on the web brings life and interactivity, adding an extra layer of compelling experience for users. In fact, to animate means to bring to life.

In this lesson we are going to walk through the basics of CSS animation.
