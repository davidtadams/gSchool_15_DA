# Github Clone

You are going to make a profile clone page for github. Your profile clone should be able to search for a github username using an ajax request to the github api.  The results should be displayed on the screen.

The results should have the following:

1. A greeting saying "Hello, [users name]"
2. The avatar image of the user
3. A list of all of the public repositories owned by the user.

### APIs You Will Need

* [Github user search](https://developer.github.com/v3/users/)
* [Github repo search](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/) - Make sure to use the public api!

A large part of the assignment will be getting familiar with looking at documentation.  Try to figure out what the api has to offer by looking at the docs.

### Styling

Make the website a little prettier.  You can modify the html to make it look nicer.  Just don't change the html for any content changes.
