# Gulp Warmup

## Setup

Install all npm packages:
```sh
$ npm install
```

## Setup Gulp tasks

* Create tasks:
  * Compile the es2015 JavaScript with [`gulp-babel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-babel)
  * Compile the SCSS to CSS with [`gulp-sass`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass)
  * Copy the HTML file over

All source files are in the `./src` folder.
All compiled files should be placed in the `./build` folder.

## Bonus Tasks

* Automatically reload the page when a change is detected with [`gulp-livereload`](https://github.com/vohof/gulp-livereload)
* Minify the HTML, CSS, or JS
* Bundle jQuery through `npm` with [`gulp-webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-webpack) instead of a CDN
* Anything else!

## Hint

There is a solution on the `solution` branch of the repo.
