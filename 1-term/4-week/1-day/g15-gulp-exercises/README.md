# Gulp Exercises

[![Gulp: Automate and enhance your workflow](gulp.png)](http://gulpjs.com/)

If you have multiple steps in your project's build, you could benefit from automating it. If you need to do at least one of these things: compile your SCSS, lint your JS, transpile your ES2015 JS, run tests, minify your code, bundle your CommonJS modules, or anything else in order to run the project, you should be using Gulp.

Go into each folder in-order and do the exercises to learn how to use Gulp.
