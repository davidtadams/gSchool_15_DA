  console.log("Hello, my name is [insert your name here]")

You'll have to:

- define a class named `Exercise01`
- define the `main` method correctly
- use System.out.println to print the string
- compile with `javac Exercise01.java`
- run with `java Exercise01`

class Exercise01 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, my name is David");
  }
