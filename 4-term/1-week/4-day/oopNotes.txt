4 Pillars of OOP
  - abstraction
  - encapsulation
  - inheritance
  - Polymorphism

Abstraction
  the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality
  java -> interface and abstract class

Encapsulation


Inheritance
  - single inheritance (parent child)
  - multiple inheritance (inheriting from multiple classes directly, more than one parent class)
  - multilevel inheritance (multiple levels down)

Polymorphism
  a single interface that works for many types
