What is JavaScript?
  - dynamically typed interpreted language

What is the difference between JavaScript and Java?
  - java is statically typed and compiled

JS types? (there are 8)
Primitives:
  Number
  String
  Boolean
  Null
  Undefined
  Function
Object
Symbol

NaN (type is number), NaN === NaN -> false

What is the use of the isNaN function?
  to check if something is not a number
  it is hard to compare NaN to anything
  NaN is of type number

Is it possible to break JS code up into multiple lines
  you can use the backslash character

ASI
  Automatic semicolon insertion
  you don't have to put semicolons in code

JS
  Netscape
  1995
  Brandon Eich

Undeclared variables
  var variablename doesn't exist

Undefined variables
  when you do var test
  test is now undefined

Global Variables
  1. var a in global scope
  2. a = 3 when there is no var a declaration anywhere, it will auto go to global scope
  3. attach to window object window.a = 3
    for node: global.a = 3

Polluting the namespace
  global variables do this
  libraries can pollute the global scope if not poorly designed

Prompt Box
  built into the browser
  you can enter stuff into it and get the value of the thing back
  type of the Modal dialogue

What is the this keyword?!!!!!! (HUGE QUESTION)
  Gives you a reference to your current scope
  Current context
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this
  Real answer:
    1. Call and Apply
      Call = comma
      Apply = array
    2. Bind - whatever you bound to the function
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
    3. This refers to the calling object for a method
    4. default value is Global Scope - if all else fails, this is where it looks

Functions are the only thing in JS that create scope

What are the timers in JS?
  1. SetTimeout
  2. SetInterval
    how to stop a setInterval -> clearInterval
  Difference: Interval repeats, timeout only happens once

== vs ===
  == coerces types
  === strictly checks value
  1 excuse for ==, user input checking numbers, can coerce to strings
    can use parse int to get around it

Form Submit in JS
  submit is a built in method
  Can intercept the form on submit in JS

JS looping structures
  do while
  while
  for
  for each
  map (arrays)
  reduce (arrays)
  for in (objects)
  for of (objects)

Navigator Object
  can get the client OS
  along with other stuff like Lat and Long

Delete Keyword
  Deletes anything that wasn't set with var
  such as object keys

location.href
  reload page to certain url

JS Scope
  JS is lexically scoped
    specifically it is functional scope
  is not block scope, it is functional scope
  let allows you to use block scope in ES2015

2 basic data types in JS
  1. primitive
  2. reference

Error types
  1. Compile error
    Syntax error. code can't compile and won't run
  2. Run time error
    something that is happening during program execution
    unhandled exception
  3. Logic error
    output is not what it should be based off of input

2 favorite JS interview questions
  1. JS and `this`
    see above
  2. What is a closure?
    see below

Closures
  when in an inner function can reference an outer functions scope after that outer function is finished

Anonymous Function
  doesn't have a name
  example: callbacks
  you can name an anonymous function
    if you do this and there is an error, it shows up in stack trace instead of anonymous function

Event bubbling and event capturing

JS IS case sensitive

First class functions
  functions can be treated like other value types
  1. you can pass them into a function
  2. return them from a function
  3. treat them like values

Decode URI
Encode URI
  encode and decode url characters to be in correct format
  encode url to contain 'illegal' characters that are not supported

ECMAscript vs JavaScript
  ECMA is the standards body
  ECMAscript is the spec that describes the language
  JavaScript is the implementation of the language
    such as V8
    Chakra
    Edge
  ECMAscript came after JavaScript
  W3C wouldn't touch JS in terms of standards
  JS needed a standards body
  TC39
  Technical Committee 39 is the working committee for JS
