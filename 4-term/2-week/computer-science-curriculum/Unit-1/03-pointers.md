# Pointers

In lower level languages, when we want to access a variable we need to know its memory __address__ (you can think of this as a house address). A computer program can find a variable as long as it knows its memory address. Pointers provide us a way to deal directly with these addresses. A pointer is a programming language object, whose value refers directly to (or "points to") another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its address.

However, pointers can be very challenging to manage and even used dangerously (overused) so that many higher level languages hide them entirely.

Read more about pointers [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28computer_programming%29)

Here is an example of a linked list with pointers (how you would implement this in a lower level language)
