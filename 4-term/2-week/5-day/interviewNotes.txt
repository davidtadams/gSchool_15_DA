Whiteboarding
  DON'T GO DARK!
  Steps:
    Ask about the format!
      edge cases?
      psuedo code?
      handle errors?
    Sample I/O
    Narrate
    Diagram the flow (of inputs to outputs)

Cultural Interviews
  1. So tell me about yourself?
    -experience?
    -personality traits?
    -communication?
    Practice
      elevator pitch
      craft a story
      short/dense/tight dialogue
  2. Why do you want to work here?
    Do you know what we do? (that's what they are looking for)
    Passion
    How do you add value?
  3. Tell me about a problem/project?
    How do you solve problems?
    Can you speak about a technical problem plainly?
    How do you respond to adversity?
    Responding to conflict?
    wrap all of this into a story
      how you grew?
      how you learned from others
      what you took out of it?

What you say in interviews needs to be true, but not factual!
  It doesn't have to have literally happened to you in that order on the same
    project.
