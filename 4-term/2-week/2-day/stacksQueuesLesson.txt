Stacks and Queues with Kyle

Stacks
  can Push and Pop
  Stacks are LIFO
  Last in first out
  stacks give us efficiency
  an array has some of the same methods as stacks but is not a stack
  The top of the stack is all we care about

  Methods:
    push
    pop
    maybes:
      swap
      length (common)
      clear/purge
      peak (look at what is on top) (common)

Queue
  FIFO
  first in first out
  things go in at the beginning of the queue and out at the end

Implement a stack and a queue in Java by Friday
