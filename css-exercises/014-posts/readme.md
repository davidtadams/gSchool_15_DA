# Broken Posts

Something is wrong with the posts. The services section is overlapping with it. Services are suposed to be at the very bottom, underneath the posts.

## Notes:
* Don't change the HTML.
* Only adjust styles under "/* Code Under This Line */"


## Style
* Add custom CSS to app.css

## Server
1. In the terminal, `cd` into the `014-posts` directory
1. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` to start a server
1. Visit localhost:8000 to see the index page
