# Final Assignment: React Todo

## Getting started

You've made it to the end of this unit, congratulations! Your assignment is to build a Todo App in React using everything you have learned so far!

## Requirements

* A user should be able to create Todos
* A user should be able to delete individual Todos
* A user should be able to edit individual todos

## Here is an example

## Bonuses

- Add a Backend! Save your todos to a database and use AJAX to perform CRUD on them.
- Separate Your Components into different files. Instead of using multiple script tags, use a tool like [browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to create modules on the front-end!
