## Fuzzy Search

Build a search engine that takes in a search word (a string) and looks through a list (an array of strings) and returns another list of "fuzzy" matches to the search word. Fuzzy search means there is a tolerance of one character being incorrect. For example, a search of "Jesz" would return "Jess".
