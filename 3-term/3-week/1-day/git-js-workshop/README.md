# git-js-workshop

This workshop is intended to take someone from the basics of Javascript, to ES6 and tooling (a HUGE topic in JS),
to React.js, and finally to React.js with Redux.

##### Things this workshop intends on doing

- Provide a follow-along, incremental guide to React.js with Redux for any beginner to Javascript
- Unveil most of the mainstream Javascript pitfalls without straying far from the center

- Take anyone to proficient level of Javascript
- Dive into complicated areas of Javascript, ES6, React.js, or Redux
