Notes from React Lunch with Jean de Klerk from Pivotal
github jadekler

React.js
React is solely for the view layer
Only the V in MVC

Has a github repo he is going off of
  https://github.com/jadekler/git-js-workshop

Franc npm module
  https://www.npmjs.com/package/franc

Inside the react this element
there is state
  this.state
  this.setState()
react gives you a function called getInitialState()
  Lifecycle of react component, setup, initial, destroy

The react lifecycle is very simple
  not much magic happening behind the scenes

React makes the assumption that every component is a pure function stateless

using System.js for transpiling into babel

React with Flux and Redux
Flux is also by facebook
Redux is a more pure version than Flux

Flux -> says you can have multiple data stores
Redux -> says you can have only one
