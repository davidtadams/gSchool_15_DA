## Refactor the raw pizza size 2 way data binding to Angular. 

This is intended as a demonstraction. Students should already have finished this excercise: [https://github.com/gSchool/raw-two-way-data-binding/](https://github.com/gSchool/raw-two-way-data-binding/)

As a live demonstration, we'll take the [finished 05.html](https://github.com/gSchool/raw-two-way-data-binding/blob/tb-solution/05.html) file, and 'angularize' it into the application in this folder. Look at the comments for the  steps to follow, it's quite simple and you get to delete a LOT of javascript code which feels nice.
