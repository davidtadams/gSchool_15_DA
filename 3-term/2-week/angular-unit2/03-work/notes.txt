Notes

There are only three ways a component (object or function) can get a hold of its dependencies:
  The component can create the dependency, typically using the new operator.
  The component can look up the dependency, by referring to a global variable.
  The component can have the dependency passed to it where it is needed.

Dependencies are called services in angular

Dependent objects
  controller
  directive
  filter

Angular supports 3 ways to annotate our code (define dependencies):
  Implicit annotation
  Inline array annotation
  $inject property annotation
