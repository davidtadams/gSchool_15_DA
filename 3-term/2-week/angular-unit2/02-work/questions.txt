What is the difference between $scope.digest and $scope.apply
  - When you call $scope.digest it only runs the digest loop from that particular scope, but when you call $apply, that uses the $rootScope and goes through all scopes in the application.
  - If you have many watches and scopes, and you know that you only need to modify a single scope it is best to use $digest, otherwise use $apply.

The digest loop is what runs after the $apply function brings a callback into the angular context.

Dirty Checking
  Dirty Checking is a process to check if the value of an expression/variable has changed. Dirty Checking simply compares an old value with a new one to see if it has changed.
