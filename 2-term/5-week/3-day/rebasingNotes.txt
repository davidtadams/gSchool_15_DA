Rebasing - Kyle

git topic
how to pull in new work that is happening if you are working on a branch
it allows you to use branches and then have your commit history cleaner because
  it doesn't have merge commits
the ability to manipulate history to make it look like everything was done in order
  even though it didn't happen in order
rebasing danger
  Golden rule: DON'T CHANGE HISTORY ON SOMETHING THAT IS PUBLIC!!

Squashing
  If you have numerous commits that are all related, you can squash them into
    one commit

$ git rebase -i to-be-squashed~3

~3 means to squash the last three commits in the branch

git push -f origin master
to a push force
