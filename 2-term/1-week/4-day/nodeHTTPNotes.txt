Guided questions:
What are some pieces that make up a URL?
  Protocol - typically http
  host or hostname
  subdomain
  domain
  TLD
  Path

What is a static url vs a dynamic url?
  Static urls vs dynamic urls have to do with the document that
  is being returned for the url. If the server returning the document
  does not have to do any sort of computation, then the url is static.
  If the server does have to do any sort of computation it is dynamic.

What are some common HTTP status codes?
  200 OK
  404 Not found
  500 Internal Server Error
  550 Permission Denied

What type of data is sent over the line with HTTP?
  Plain text!

What is the same-origin policy?
  Two pages have the same origin if the protocol,
  port (if one is specified), and host are the same for both pages.
