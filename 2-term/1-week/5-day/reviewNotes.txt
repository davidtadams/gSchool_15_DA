ES6 will let you do block level scope in JS
ES5 does not have block level scope
  if statements and other blocks do not create their own scope
  only functions do this

var hoisting
  moving all of the var declarations to the top of the scope

function hoisting
  functions are hoisted first before variables

lexical scoping
  scope chains

How do you promisify a function?
  var someAyncThing = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    $.get("google.com", function(data) {
      resolve(data);
    });
  });

  someAsyncThing().then(function(data) {
    //do something
  });
