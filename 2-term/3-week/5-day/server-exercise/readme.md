# Llama Farm

![Llama](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_3jxLAfErGw/TZbB-5IA76I/AAAAAAAAAAo/x3lumBp_yPo/s1600/llama1.jpg)

Behold my beautiful farm! All it needs are beautiful llamas.
Can you help me out?
I need you to create a server to store the name and image of the llamas.

## Exercise

The entire client side is complete.
Your job is to create a server and the routes to finish the CRUD app.
The server needs to be able to provide all the llamas, adopt a llama,
rename a llama, and sadly, kill a llama.

Run your server locally on port 8080. The app makes ajax calls to `http:localhost:8080`.
Look at the app.js file for route hints. Do not modify the file.

## Usage

Simply clone and run `http-server -p 3000`. To install run `npm install -g http-server`.

Then create your server (in a different directory) and run locally on port 8080.

Good luck!
