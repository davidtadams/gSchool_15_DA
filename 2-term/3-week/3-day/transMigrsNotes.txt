Guided Questions:
What is the ACID model?
  The ACID model makes sure that database transactions are processed reliably
  A = Atomicity
    all or nothing. if a transaction fails, nothing happens
  C = Consistency
    only valid data gets added to the database
  I = Isolation
    If you do two inserts, they won't happen at the same time, isolates data
  D = Durability
    Database will not lose data on system failure
    Once a transaction is committed it will stay there

What is a transactional database?
  When a database supports rolling back an operation if something happens
  such as an error or failure.
  They allow correct recovery from failure.

How do you create a transaction with knex?
  passing a handler function into knex.transaction();
  http://knexjs.org/#Transactions

  When would you use a transaction?
    When you are doing more than one thing at a time.
    Any sort of multiple things, especially if they depend on each other.

When do you do a schema migration?
  After a database is already created
  When you are updating or adding something to a schema
  You can also revert/roll back with a schema migration
  Any time you make a change to your database

What are the benefits of schema migrations?
  It makes updating a database much easier.
